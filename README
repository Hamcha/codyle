Requires astyle & hub (already setup and latest version pls, as it has pull-request -F).
Best bot ever, mostly written in shellscript (and let's try to keep it bash-free, ok?)


TODO

- Same PR message is boring and not that credible, make a prfile generator (can be python, ruby, whatever)
- Script that searches for C/C++ repos and calls fork.sh on them (again, most langs acceptable)
